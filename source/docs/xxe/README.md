# Introduction

## What?

XML external entity attacks (XXEs) are fascinating vulnerabilities that target the XML parsers of an application. 

## Why?

XXEs can be very impactful bugs, as they can lead to confidential information disclosure, SSRFs, and DoS attacks. But they are also difficult to understand and exploit.
