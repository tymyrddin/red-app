# Introduction

## What?

Business (application) logic flaws are often the most critical in terms of consequences, as they are deeply tied into the company's process.

## Why?

Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behaviour. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal.
