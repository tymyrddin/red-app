# Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-weak-isolation-on-dual-use-endpoint) makes a flawed assumption about the user's privilege level based on their input. As a result, you can exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users' accounts. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. With Burp running, log in and access your account page.
2. Change your password.
3. Study the ``POST /my-account/change-password`` request in Burp Repeater.
4. Notice that if you remove the ``current-password`` parameter entirely, you are able to successfully change your password without providing your current one.
5. Observe that the user whose password is changed is determined by the ``username`` parameter. Set ``username=administrator`` and send the request again.
6. Log out and notice that you can now successfully log in as the ``administrator`` using the password you just set.
7. Go to the admin panel and delete Carlos to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; access the administrator account and delete Carlos.
