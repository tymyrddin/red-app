# Authentication bypass via flawed state machine

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-state-machine) makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the login process.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. With Burp running, complete the login process with `wiener:peter` and notice that you need to select your role before you are taken to the home page.
2. Use the content discovery tool to identify the `/admin` path.
3. Try browsing to `/admin` directly from the role selection page and observe that this doesn't work.
4. Log out and then go back to the login page. In Burp, turn on proxy intercept then log in.
5. Forward the `POST /login` request. The next request is `GET /role-selector`. Drop this request and then browse to the lab's home page. Observe that your role has defaulted to the `administrator` role and you have access to the admin panel.
6. Delete Carlos to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in; exploit the flaw to bypass the lab's authentication, access the admin interface, and delete Carlos.
