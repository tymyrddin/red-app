# Blind OS command injection with time delays

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-time-delays) contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function. The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the `email` parameter, changing it to: `email=x||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||`
3. Observe that the response takes 10 seconds to return.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.
