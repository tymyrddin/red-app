# OS command injection, simple case

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple) contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker: The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that checks the stock level. 
2. Modify the `storeID` parameter, giving it the value `1|whoami`. 
3. Observe that the response contains the name of the current user.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.
