# URL normalization

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-normalization) contains an XSS vulnerability that is not directly exploitable due to browser URL-encoding. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. In Burp Repeater, browse to any non-existent path, such as ``GET /random``. Notice that the path you requested is reflected in the error message.
2. Add a suitable reflected XSS payload to the request line:

```text
GET /random</p><script>alert(1)</script><p>foo
```

3. Notice that if you request this URL in your browser, the payload doesn't execute because it is URL-encoded.
4. In Burp Repeater, poison the cache with your payload and then immediately load the URL in your browser. This time, the ``alert()`` is executed because your browser's encoded payload was URL-decoded by the cache, causing a cache hit with the earlier request.
5. Re-poison the cache then immediately go to the lab and click "Deliver link to victim". Submit your malicious URL. The lab will be solved when the victim visits the link.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to take advantage of the cache's normalization process to exploit this vulnerability. Find the XSS vulnerability and inject a payload that will execute `alert(1)` in the victim's browser. Then, deliver the malicious URL to the victim.
