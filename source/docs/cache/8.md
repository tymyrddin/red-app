# Web cache poisoning via a fat GET request

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-fat-get) is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. It accepts `GET` requests that have a body, but does not include the body in the cache key. A user regularly visits this site's home page using Chrome. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Observe that every page imports the script ``/js/geolocate.js``, executing the callback function ``setCountryCookie()``. Send the request ``GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie`` to Burp Repeater.
2. Notice that you can control the name of the function that is called in the response by passing in a duplicate ``callback`` parameter via the request body. Also notice that the cache key is still derived from the original ``callback`` parameter in the request line:

```text
GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie
…
callback=arbitraryFunction

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Cache-Key: /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie
…
arbitraryFunction({"country" : "United Kingdom"})
```

3. Send the request again, but this time pass in ``alert(1)`` as the callback function. Check that you can successfully poison the cache.
4. Remove any cache busters and re-poison the cache. The lab will solve when the victim user visits any page containing this resource import URL.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(1)` in the victim's browser.
