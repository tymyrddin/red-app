# File path traversal, simple case

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-simple) contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value:

```text
../../../etc/passwd
```

3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the ``/etc/passwd`` file.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
