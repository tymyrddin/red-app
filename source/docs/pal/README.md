# Introduction

## What?

Hands-on and reframing Portswigger lab writeups gradually towards [reports](red-bbh:docs/essentials/report), (focused on creating PoC's).

## Why?

* A Proof of Concept (PoC) is a test run that proves the basic feasibility of an attack for one or several representative use cases.
* Making the patterns stick in mind and be easily accessible.
* Vulnerable applications and systems are great ways to test skill sets in virtual environments. This will also provide an estimate of what we can contribute in the real world.

## How?

* [Cross-site scripting](xss.md)
* [SQL injection](sqli.md)
* [Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](csrf.md)
* [Clickjacking](clickjacking.md)
* [DOM-based vulnerabilities](dom.md)
* [Cross-origin resource sharing](cors.md)
* [XML external entity (XXE) injection](xxe.md)
* [Server-side request forgery (SSRF)](ssrf.md)
* [HTTP request smuggling](smuggling.md)
* [OS command injection](os.md)
* [Server-side template injection](ssti.md)
* [Directory traversal](traversal.md)
* [Access control vulnerabilities](access.md)
* [Authentication](auth.md)
* [WebSockets](sockets.md)
* [Web cache poisoning](cache.md)
* [Insecure deserialization](id.md)
* [Information disclosure](disclosure.md)
* [Business logic vulnerabilities](business.md)
* [HTTP Host header attacks](headers.md)
* [OAuth authentication](oauth.md)
* [File upload vulnerabilities](file-upload.md)
* [Flawed handling of JSON web tokens](jwt.md)
* [Prototype pollution](pollution.md)
