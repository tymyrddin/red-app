# Scanning applications

Application scanning tools can be used to perform an audit on an application. There are basically two types of
application audit tools: Dynamic and static.

* A dynamic analysis tool assesses vulnerabilities in an application by analysing the behaviour of the application
while it is running (how it responds to input).
* In a static analysis, the source code is reviewed for vulnerabilities. Can be done manually or using
a static code analysis tool.
