# Scanning applications

Application scanning tools can be used to perform an audit on an application. There are basically two types of
application audit tools: Dynamic and static.

* A dynamic analysis tool assesses vulnerabilities in an application by analysing the behaviour of the application
while it is running (how it responds to input).
* In a static analysis, the source code is reviewed for vulnerabilities. Can be done manually or using
a static code analysis tool.

## Usage

* Open the application through the terminal or by clicking on the icon
* Yes, persist the session
* Enter target web address in the green highlighted box and click attack
* Wait few minutes and analyse results
