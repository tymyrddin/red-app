# Introduction

## What?

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). 

## Why?

It also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented.

## How?

* [Same-origin policy (SOP) vulnerabilities](sop.md)
* [CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection](1.md)
* [CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin](2.md)
* [CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols](3.md)
* [CORS vulnerability with internal network pivot attack](4.md)
