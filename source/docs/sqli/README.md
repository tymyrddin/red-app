# Introduction

## What?

SQL injection has been at the top of the OWASP vulnerability listings for many years, the reason being that, if identified and exploited to the full extent, they produce catastrophic outcomes.

## Why?

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve.

## How?
