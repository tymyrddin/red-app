# Source code disclosure via backup files

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-via-backup-files) leaks its source code via backup files in a hidden directory.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Browse to ``/robots.txt`` and notice that it reveals the existence of a ``/backup`` directory. Browse to ``/backup`` to find the file ``ProductTemplate.java.bak``. Alternatively, right-click on the lab in the site map and go to "Engagement tools" > "Discover content". Then, launch a content discovery session to discover the ``/backup`` directory and its contents.
2. Browse to ``/backup/ProductTemplate.java.bak`` to access the source code.
3. In the source code, notice that the connection builder contains the hard-coded password for a Postgres database.
4. Go back to the lab, click "Submit solution", and enter the database password to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to identify and submit the database password, which is hard-coded in the leaked source code.
