# DOM XSS using web messages and a JavaScript URL

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/controlling-the-web-message-source/lab-dom-xss-using-web-messages-and-a-javascript-url) demonstrates a DOM-based redirection vulnerability that is triggered by web messaging.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Note the home page contains an `addEventListener()` call that listens for a web message. The JavaScript contains a flawed `indexOf()` check that looks for the strings `http:` or `https:` anywhere within the web message. It also contains the sink `location.href`.
2. Go to the exploit server and add the following `iframe` to the body, remembering to replace `lab-id`:

```text
<iframe src="https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/" onload="this.contentWindow.postMessage('javascript:print()//http:','*')">
```
    
3. **Store** the exploit and deliver it to the victim.

This script sends a web message containing an arbitrary JavaScript payload, along with the string `http:`. The second argument specifies that any `targetOrigin` is allowed for the web message.

When the iframe loads, the `postMessage()` method sends the JavaScript payload to the main page. The event listener spots the `http:` string and proceeds to send the payload to the `location.href` sink, where the `print()` function is called.

## Exploitability

To solve this lab, an attacker needs to construct an HTML page on the exploit server that exploits this vulnerability and calls the `print()` function.
