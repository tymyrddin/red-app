# DOM XSS using web messages and JSON.parse

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/controlling-the-web-message-source/lab-dom-xss-using-web-messages-and-json-parse) uses web messaging and parses the message as JSON.  

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Note the home page contains an event listener that listens for a web message. This event listener expects a string that is parsed using `JSON.parse()`. In the JavaScript, we can see that the event listener expects a type property and that the `load-channel` case of the `switch` statement changes the `iframe` `src` attribute.
2. Go to the exploit server and add the following `iframe` to the body field, remembering to replace `lab-id`:

```text
<iframe src=https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/ onload='this.contentWindow.postMessage("{\"type\":\"load-channel\",\"url\":\"javascript:print()\"}","*")'>
```

3. **Store** the exploit and deliver it to the victim.

When the iframe we constructed loads, the `postMessage()` method sends a web message to the home page with the type `load-channel`. The event listener receives the message and parses it using `JSON.parse()` before sending it to the `switch`.

The `switch` triggers the `load-channel` case, which assigns the url property of the message to the `src` attribute of the `ACMEplayer.element` `iframe`. However, in this case, the url property of the message actually contains our JavaScript payload.

As the second argument specifies that any `targetOrigin` is allowed for the web message, and the event handler does not contain any form of origin check, the payload is set as the `src` of the `ACMEplayer.element` `iframe`. The `print()` function is called when the victim loads the page in their browser.

## Exploitability

To solve the lab, an attacker needs to construct an HTML page on the exploit server that exploits this vulnerability and calls the `print()` function.
