# Introduction

## What?

DOM-based vulnerabilities arise when a website contains JavaScript that takes an attacker-controllable value, known as a source, and passes it into a dangerous function, known as a sink. 

## Why?

Many DOM-based vulnerabilities can be traced back to problems with the way client-side code manipulates attacker-controllable data. 

## How?

* [DOM XSS using web messages](1.md)
* [DOM XSS using web messages and a JavaScript URL](2.md)
* [DOM XSS using web messages and JSON.parse](3.md)
* [DOM-based open redirection](4.md)
* [DOM-based cookie manipulation](5.md)
* [Exploiting DOM clobbering to enable XSS](6.md)
* [Clobbering DOM attributes to bypass HTML filters](7.md)
