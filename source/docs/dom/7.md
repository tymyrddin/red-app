# Clobbering DOM attributes to bypass HTML filters

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/dom-clobbering/lab-dom-clobbering-attributes-to-bypass-html-filters) uses the `HTMLJanitor` library, which is vulnerable to DOM clobbering.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Go to one of the blog posts and create a comment containing the following HTML:

```text
<form id=x tabindex=0 onfocus=print()><input id=attributes>
```
    
2. Go to the exploit server and add the following iframe to the body - Change the URL to contain your `lab-id` and make sure that the `postId` parameter matches the `postId` of the blog post into which you injected the HTML in the previous step:

```text
<iframe src=https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=3 onload="setTimeout(()=>this.src=this.src+'#x',500)">
```

3. **Store** the exploit and deliver it to the victim. The next time the page loads, the `print()` function is called.

The library uses the `attributes` property to filter HTML attributes. However, it is still possible to clobber the `attributes` property itself, causing the length to be undefined. This allows us to inject any attributes we want into the `form` element. In this case, we use the `onfocus` attribute to smuggle the `print()` function.

When the `iframe` is loaded, after a 500ms delay, it adds the `#x` fragment to the end of the page URL. The delay is necessary to make sure that the comment containing the injection is loaded before the JavaScript is executed. This causes the browser to focus on the element with the ID `x`, which is the form we created inside the comment. The `onfocus` event handler then calls the `print()` function.

## Exploitability

To solve this lab, an attacker needs to construct a vector that bypasses the filter and uses DOM clobbering to inject a vector that calls the `print()` function. The attacker may need to use the exploit server in order to make your vector auto-execute in the victim's browser. _Note: The intended solution to this lab will not work in Firefox. Use Chrome._
