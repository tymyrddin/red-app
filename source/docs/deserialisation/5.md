# Exploiting Java deserialisation with Apache Commons

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-exploiting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons) uses a serialization-based session mechanism and loads the Apache Commons Collections library. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in to your own account and observe that the session cookie contains a serialized Java object. Send a request containing your session cookie to Burp Repeater.
2. Download the [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) tool and execute the following command:

```text
java -jar path/to/ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections4 'rm /home/carlos/morale.txt' | base64
```
    
3. This will generate a Base64-encoded serialized object containing your payload.
4. In Burp Repeater, replace your session cookie with the malicious one you just created. Select the entire cookie and then URL-encode it.
5. Send the request to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

Although attackers do not have source code access, they can still exploit this lab using pre-built gadget chains. An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; use a third-party tool to generate a malicious serialized object containing a remote code execution payload; and pass this object into the website to delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.
