# Application Logic Errors and Broken Access Control

## General choreography

1. Learn about the target application. The more you understand about the architecture and development process of a web application, the better you will be at spotting these vulnerabilities.
2. Intercept requests while browsing the site and pay attention to sensitive functionalities. Keep track of every request sent during these actions.
3. Use your creativity to think of ways to bypass access control or otherwise interfere with application logic.
4. Think of ways to combine the vulnerability youâ€™ve found with other vulnerabilities to maximize the potential impact of the flaw.
5. Draft the report.

## Escalation

Escalating application logic errors and broken access control depends entirely on the nature of the flaw you find. But a general rule of thumb is that you can try to combine the application logic error or broken access control with other vulnerabilities to increase their impact.

A broken access control that gives you access to the admin panel with a console or application deployment capabilities can lead to [remote code execution](rce.md). 

If you can find the configuration files of a web application, you can search for CVEs for the software versions in use to further compromise the application. 

You might also find credentials in a file that can be used to access different machines on the network.

Think of ways malicious users can exploit these vulnerabilities to the fullest extent, and communicate their impact in detail in the report.
