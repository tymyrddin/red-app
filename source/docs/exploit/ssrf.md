# Server-Side Request Forgery

A server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack involves forcing some server-side application to make HTTP requests to a 
domain of our choosing. This can sometimes grant access to internal resources or unprotected admin panels.

## General choreography

1. Spot the features prone to SSRFs and take notes for future reference.
2. Set up a callback listener to detect blind SSRFs by using an online service, Netcat, or Burpâ€™s Collaborator feature.
3. Provide the potentially vulnerable endpoints with common internal addresses or the address of your callback listener.
4. Check if the server responds with information that confirms the SSRF. Or, in the case of a blind SSRF, check your server logs for requests from the target server.
5. In the case of a blind SSRF, check if the server behaviour differs when you request different hosts or ports.
6. If SSRF protection is implemented, try to bypass it by using the strategies discussed in this chapter.
7. Pick a tactic to escalate the SSRF.
8. Draft report.
