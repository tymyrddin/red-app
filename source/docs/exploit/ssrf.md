# Server-Side Request Forgery

A server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack involves forcing some server-side application to make HTTP requests to a 
domain of our choosing. This can sometimes grant access to internal resources or unprotected admin panels.

## General choreography

1. Spot the features prone to SSRFs and take notes for future reference.
2. Set up a callback listener to detect blind SSRFs by using an online service, Netcat, or Burp’s Collaborator feature.
3. Provide the potentially vulnerable endpoints with common internal addresses or the address of your callback listener.
4. Check if the server responds with information that confirms the SSRF. Or, in the case of a blind SSRF, check your server logs for requests from the target server.
5. In the case of a blind SSRF, check if the server behaviour differs when you request different hosts or ports.
6. If SSRF protection is implemented, try to bypass it by using the strategies discussed in this chapter.
7. Pick a tactic to escalate the SSRF.
8. Draft report.

## Escalation

What you can achieve with an SSRF usually depends on the internal services found on the network. Depending on the situation, you could use SSRF to scan the network for reachable hosts, port-scan internal machines to fingerprint internal services, collect instance metadata, bypass access controls, exfiltrate confidential data, and even execute code on reachable machines.

### Scan the network

Reachable machines are other network hosts that can be connected to via the current machine. These internal machines might host databases, internal websites, and otherwise sensitive functionalities that can be exploited.

### Pulling AWS instance metadata

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), offers an instance metadata tool that enables EC2 instances to access data about themselves by querying the API endpoint at `169.254.169.254`. 

    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

Use this URL in an endpoint vulnerable to SSRF:

    https://public.example.com/proxy?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

These API endpoints are accessible by default unless network admins specifically block or disable them. The information these services reveal is often extremely sensitive and could allow attackers to escalate SSRFs to serious information leaks and even [RCE](rce.md).

### Google Cloud metadata

If the company uses Google Cloud, query the Google Instance Metadata API instead. Google implements additional security measures for its API endpoints, so querying Google Cloud Metadata APIv1 requires one of these special headers:

    Metadata-Flavor: Google
    X-Google-Metadata-Request: True

These headers offer protection against SSRFs because most often during an SSRF, you cannot specify special headers for the forged request. We will need to find a way to forge the required headers to request instance metadata for targets that use Google Cloud.

### Exploiting blind SSRFs

Because blind SSRFs don’t return a response or error message, their exploitation is often limited to network mapping, port scanning, and service discovery. And because you can’t extract information directly from the target server, this exploitation relies heavily on inference. Yet by analyzing HTTP status codes and server response times, we can often achieve results similar to regular SSRF.

Use what you’ve found by scanning the network, identifying services, and pulling instance metadata to execute attacks that have impact. Notably, you may be able to bypass access controls, leak confidential information, and execute code.
