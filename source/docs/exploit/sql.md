# SQL Injection

SQL injection has been at the top of the OWASP vulnerability listings for many years, the reason being that, if identified and exploited to the full extent, they produce catastrophic outcomes.

## General choreography

1. Map any of the application’s endpoints that take in user input.
2. Insert test payloads into these locations to discover whether they’re vulnerable to SQL injections. If the endpoint isn’t vulnerable to classic SQL injections, try inferential techniques instead.
3. Once you’ve confirmed that the endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injections, use different SQL injection queries to leak information from the database.
4. Escalate the issue. Figure out what data you can leak from the endpoint and whether you can achieve an authentication bypass. Be careful not to execute any actions that would damage the integrity of the target’s database, such as deleting user data or modifying the structure of the database.
5. Draft up an report with an example payload that the security team can use to duplicate your results. Because SQL injections are quite technical to exploit most of the time, it’s a good idea to spend some time crafting an easy-to-understand proof of concept.
