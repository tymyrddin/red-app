# User role can be modified in user profile

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-can-be-modified-in-user-profile) has an admin panel at `/admin`. It's only accessible to logged-in users with a `roleid` of `2`. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
2. Use the provided feature to update the email address associated with your account.
3. Observe that the response contains your role ID.
4. Send the email submission request to Burp Repeater, add ``"roleid":2`` into the JSON in the request body, and resend it.
5. Observe that the response shows your ``roleid`` has changed to 2.
6. Browse to ``/admin`` and delete ``carlos``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to access the admin panel, and use it to delete the user carlos. An account with credentials `wiener:peter` is available.
