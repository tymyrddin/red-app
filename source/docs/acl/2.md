# Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url) has an unprotected admin panel. It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Review the lab home page's source using Burp Suite or your web browser's developer tools.
2. Observe that it contains some JavaScript that discloses the URL of the admin panel.
3. Load the admin panel and delete ``carlos``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to access the admin panel, and use it to delete the user carlos.
