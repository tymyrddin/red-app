# User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-unpredictable-user-ids) has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Find a blog post by ``carlos``.
2. Click on ``carlos`` and observe that the URL contains his user ID. Make a note of this ID.
3. Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
4. Change the "id" parameter to the saved user ID.
5. Retrieve and submit the API key.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in with `wiener:peter`, find the GUID for `carlos`, then submit his API key as the solution.
