# Introduction

## What?

The majority of threats related to the authentication process are associated with passwords and password-based authentication methods. Broken authentication also causes a significant amount of vulnerabilities.

## Why?

As well as potentially allowing attackers direct access to sensitive data and functionality, they also expose additional attack surface for further exploits. 

## How?

* [Authentication vulnerabilities](../techniques/auth.md)

* [2FA simple bypass](2.md)
* [Password reset broken logic](3.md)
* [Username enumeration via subtly different responses](4.md)
* [Username enumeration via response timing](5.md)
* [Broken brute-force protection, IP block](6.md)
